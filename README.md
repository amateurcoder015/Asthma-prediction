# üå¨Ô∏è Asthma Prediction using Machine Learning  

## üìå Overview  
This project applies **Machine Learning techniques** to predict the likelihood of asthma based on patient health data.  
The workflow included **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and mathematical understanding of algorithms**.  
The aim was to not only achieve good predictive accuracy but also to interpret the **factors contributing to asthma risk**.

## üéØ Objectives  
- Analyze patient health data to understand asthma-related risk factors.  
- Build and compare multiple ML models for asthma prediction.  
- Evaluate models using medical prediction metrics.  
- Strengthen understanding of ML algorithms and their mathematical foundations.

## üìÇ Dataset  
- Collected from [source, e.g., Kaggle / UCI / WHO data].  
- Features included:  
  - Demographic info (age, gender, BMI, family history)  
  - Lifestyle habits (smoking, physical activity)  
  - Medical records (allergies, respiratory issues, pollution exposure)  
- Preprocessing:  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Encoding categorical variables  
  - Feature scaling and normalization

## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Distribution of age, BMI, smoking habits vs. asthma occurrence  
- Correlation heatmaps between medical/lifestyle features and asthma risk  
- Comparison of asthma prevalence across demographics  
- Visualizations with **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly**

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models Implemented  
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Neural Networks (if applicable)  

For each model, I studied both **implementation** and the **mathematical background** (probability, optimization, cost functions).

## üìä Model Evaluation  
- Metrics:  
  - **Accuracy**  
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-Score**  
  - **ROC-AUC** (important for medical predictions)  
  - **Confusion Matrix** (false positives/negatives analysis)  
- Compared models to identify the most reliable for medical use.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- Libraries:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `plotly`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `xgboost`  

---

## üìå Future Work  
- Deploy as a **Streamlit/Flask web app** for real-time asthma risk prediction.  
- Explore **deep learning** models (e.g., ANN, LSTM with longitudinal patient data).  
- Apply **SHAP/LIME** for explainable AI (to interpret feature importance for doctors).  

---

## üôå Learning Outcomes  
- Learned how to apply ML in the **healthcare domain**.  
- Strengthened both **theory and practice** of classification models.  
- Understood how **medical prediction models** require careful evaluation beyond accuracy (focus on recall & false negatives).
